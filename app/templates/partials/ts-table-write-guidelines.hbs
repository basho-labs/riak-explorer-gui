<h4>Table Write Editor</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each row you wish to insert should be represented as an array of field values, separated by a comma</li>
  <li>Row field values must be in the same order as defined in the table. Refer to the table fields in the above table
    reference for order.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>General Guidelines</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Batches should not be too large. Our testing revealed 100 rows per write as a sweet spot, but you should expect
    different results depending on your hardware and schema.
  </li>
  <li>Writes will assume that fields are in the same order as they’ve been declared in the table.</li>
  <li>Timestamps should be in Unix epoch/UTC milliseconds.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tuning batches</h4>
<p>
  Batches of data from a single write are packaged for delivery to each destination server as a performance
  optimization. For Enterprise customers using <a href="http://docs.basho.com/riak/ts/1.3.0/using/mdc/" target="_blank">MDC</a>,
  those batches are sent to the remote cluster via realtime sync.
</p>

<p>
  It is possible to specify an approximate largest-batch size for tuning purposes. By default, batches have a soft cap
  size of 1MB of data, which we’ve found to be a reasonable size to avoid network congestion.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to adjust that value, the configuration parameter <code>timeseries_max_batch_size</code> under <code>riak_kv</code>
  in <a href="http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/configuring/reference/#the-advanced-config-file" target="_blank">advanced.config</a>
  can be defined. The value is in bytes.
